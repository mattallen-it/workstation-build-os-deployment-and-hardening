# Discrete GPU Installation and Verification

## Objective

Install and verify a discrete GPU on the workstation used to host the Monroe Redstone Technology Group (MRTG) IAM lab environment.

While the virtualized IAM infrastructure does not require GPU acceleration, a dedicated GPU improves host system responsiveness and ensures stable display output when managing multiple virtual machines.

## Hardware

**GPU Installed**

• MSI NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti  

**Motherboard**

• ASUS TUF Gaming B650-PLUS WIFI

## Pre-Installation State

Prior to installation, the system relied on the CPU's integrated graphics.  
The primary PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard was unoccupied.
