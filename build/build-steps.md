# System Assembly Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process used to assemble the custom gaming PC, focusing on hardware installation order, best practices, and validation checkpoints.

---

## 1. Pre-Assembly Preparation

- Verified compatibility of all components (CPU, motherboard, memory, storage, cooler, case, power supply)
- Prepared a clean, static-safe workspace
- Gathered required tools (Phillips screwdriver, thermal paste if required)
- Reviewed motherboard documentation for slot layout, power connectors, and front-panel headers

---

## 2. Motherboard Component Installation

### CPU Installation
- Installed AMD Ryzen 5 7600X3D into the AM5 socket using manufacturer alignment indicators
- Secured the retention arm and visually confirmed proper seating

### Memory Installation
- Installed 2x16GB DDR5 memory modules into the recommended dual-channel slots per motherboard documentation
- Verified full seating via audible click and visual inspection

### Storage Installation
- Installed Samsung 990 Pro NVMe SSD into the primary M.2 slot
- Secured the SSD using the motherboard retention mechanism and installed the integrated heatsink

## 3. CPU Cooler Installation

- Mounted Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARGB using AM5-compatible mounting hardware
- Applied appropriate thermal interface material
- Installed dual fans and connected fan and ARGB headers
- Verified cooler clearance with memory modules and case dimensions

---

## 4. Case Preparation and Motherboard Installation

- Removed case panels to allow full access to internal compartments
- Installed motherboard standoffs according to ATX layout
- Mounted motherboard into the case and secured with screws
- Verified alignment with the rear I/O opening

---

## 5. Power Supply Installation

- Installed Corsair RMe 1000W fully modular power supply into the designated PSU chamber
- Connected only required modular cables to reduce clutter and improve airflow
- Routed primary power cables (24-pin ATX and CPU EPS) prior to final cable management

---

## 6. System Wiring and Final Connections

- Routed power and data cables through designated cable management channels
- Secured excess cabling using cable ties to maintain airflow
- Connected front-panel headers (power switch and LEDs)
- Connected case fans, USB headers, and front-panel audio headers
- Performed a final visual inspection of all internal connections

---

## 7. Initial Power-On and POST Validation

- Powered on the system and verified successful POST
- Confirmed CPU, memory, and storage detection in BIOS
- Monitored initial CPU temperatures to confirm proper cooler operation

---

## 8. Pre-OS Validation

- Updated BIOS to the latest stable version
- Enabled the manufacturer-recommended memory profile (EXPO/XMP)
- Verified fan behavior and default system settings
- Saved configuration and prepared system for operating system installation

---

## 9. Completion

System assembly completed successfully with all components installed, validated, and ready for operating system installation and configuration.
