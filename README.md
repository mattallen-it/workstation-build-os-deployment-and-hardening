# Gaming PC Build & System Configuration Project

![Completed Build](images/completed-build.png)

## Project Overview

Designed and built a custom gaming PC for an 8-year-old end user with the dual purpose of delivering a reliable, age-appropriate gaming system and establishing a documented, hands-on IT project.

The primary objectives of this project were to balance performance and cost, ensure long-term usability through future-proof component selection, and gain practical experience across the full system lifecycle. Emphasis was placed on hardware planning, system assembly, firmware configuration, operating system installation, troubleshooting, performance validation, and professional technical documentation.

## Project Scope

This project documents the complete lifecycle of a custom-built desktop system, including:

- Component research and selection with performance-to-cost analysis
- Physical system assembly and validation
- BIOS configuration and firmware updates
- Operating system installation and configuration
- Driver installation and troubleshooting
- Performance testing and thermal validation
- Documentation of lessons learned and process improvements
