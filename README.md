# Windows Endpoint OS Deployment and Baseline Hardening

![Completed Build](images/completed-build.png)

## Project Overview

Designed and built a custom end-user workstation with a focus on reliability, performance, and maintainability, while producing a fully documented, hands-on IT project.

This project emphasizes the complete system lifecycle, including hardware planning, system assembly, firmware configuration, operating system deployment, baseline system hardening, troubleshooting, performance validation, and professional technical documentation.

---

## Project Scope

This project documents the complete lifecycle of a custom-built desktop system, including:

- Component research and selection with performance-to-cost analysis
- Physical system assembly and validation
- BIOS configuration and firmware updates
- Operating system installation, configuration, and baseline hardening
- Driver installation and troubleshooting
- Performance testing and thermal validation
- Documentation of lessons learned and process improvements

## Notes

This project was intentionally documented with an IT-focused mindset rather than as a hobby build. All configuration changes, troubleshooting steps, and validation activities were recorded to improve repeatability, maintainability, and clarity.

## Repository Naming Note

This repository predates my current naming standard.  
Future projects follow a consistent, standardized repository naming convention.
