# Lessons Learned

This document outlines key lessons learned during the planning, assembly, configuration, and validation of the custom gaming PC build. These insights will be applied to improve efficiency, reliability, and documentation quality in future projects.

---

## 1. Planning and Component Selection

- Extended planning time significantly reduced compatibility risks during assembly
- Bundled component purchases can provide strong value when evaluated carefully
- Prioritizing performance-per-dollar resulted in better overall system balance than selecting higher-tier components unnecessarily
- Selecting an upgrade-friendly platform (AM5, PCIe 5.0 support) improves long-term system viability

---

## 2. Assembly Process

- First-time assembly required additional time due to unfamiliarity with component installation order
- Reviewing motherboard documentation prior to assembly reduced installation errors
- Installing CPU, memory, storage, and cooler on the motherboard before case installation simplified the build process
- Cable management planning early in the build improved airflow and reduced rework

---

## 3. Firmware and Configuration

- Updating BIOS early prevented potential compatibility and stability issues
- Enabling memory profiles (EXPO/XMP) is critical to achieving expected performance
- Verifying thermal behavior in BIOS before OS installation helped identify potential issues early

---

## 4. Operating System Installation and Troubleshooting

- Windows installation may require workarounds when network drivers are not available during setup
- Understanding Windows OOBE behavior enables continued installation without unnecessary delays
- Completing OS installation using a local account simplified initial setup and driver installation
- Installing chipset and network drivers early improved overall system stability

---

## 5. Validation and Testing

- Establishing idle thermal baselines is essential before stress testing
- Sustained stress testing confirmed cooling solution adequacy and system stability
- Benchmarking provided measurable performance baselines for future comparison
- Reboot validation helped confirm system reliability after configuration changes

---

## 6. Documentation and Process Improvement

- Documenting each phase of the build improved clarity and repeatability
- Writing documentation concurrently with implementation reduced information loss
- Structured documentation makes troubleshooting and future upgrades easier
- Future builds will benefit from standardized checklists and predefined build steps

---

## 7. Future Improvements

- Reduce overall build time by applying lessons learned from initial assembly
- Introduce additional validation steps as hardware complexity increases
- Expand documentation to include upgrade scenarios and long-term maintenance
- Continue building a portfolio of documented projects to demonstrate hands-on IT experience

## Summary

This project provided practical experience across the full system lifecycle, including planning, assembly, configuration, troubleshooting, validation, and documentation. The lessons learned will directly inform future builds and support continued development of professional IT skills.
