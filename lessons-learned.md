# Lessons Learned

This document outlines key lessons learned during the planning, assembly, configuration, and validation of a custom end-user workstation. These insights will be applied to improve efficiency, reliability, and documentation quality in future IT-focused projects.

---

## 1. Planning and Component Selection

- Extended planning time significantly reduced compatibility risks during assembly
- Bundled component purchases provided strong value when evaluated against performance and reliability requirements
- Prioritizing performance-per-dollar resulted in a more balanced and cost-effective system
- Selecting an upgrade-friendly platform (e.g., AM5, PCIe support) improves long-term maintainability and lifecycle value

---

## 2. Assembly Process

- Initial assembly required additional time due to unfamiliarity with component installation order
- Reviewing motherboard and vendor documentation prior to assembly reduced installation errors
- Installing CPU, memory, storage, and cooling components on the motherboard before case installation simplified the build process
- Early cable management planning improved airflow, reduced rework, and supported future maintenance

---

## 3. Firmware and Configuration

- Updating BIOS early in the build process prevented potential compatibility and stability issues
- Enabling memory performance profiles (EXPO/XMP) was necessary to achieve expected system performance
- Verifying thermal behavior within BIOS before OS installation helped identify potential cooling issues early

---

## 4. Operating System Installation and Troubleshooting

- Windows installation may require documented workarounds when network drivers are unavailable during initial setup
- Understanding Windows OOBE behavior enabled continued installation without unnecessary delays
- Completing OS installation using a local account simplified initial setup and driver installation
- Installing chipset and network drivers early improved overall system stability and performance

---

## 5. Validation and Testing

- Establishing idle thermal baselines was essential prior to stress testing
- Sustained stress testing confirmed cooling solution adequacy and system stability
- Benchmarking provided measurable performance baselines for future comparison
- Reboot validation helped confirm reliability after configuration changes and driver installation

---

## 6. Documentation and Process Improvement

- Documenting each phase of the project improved clarity, repeatability, and troubleshooting efficiency
- Writing documentation concurrently with implementation reduced information loss
- Structured documentation simplified validation, future upgrades, and maintenance planning
- Future builds will benefit from standardized checklists and predefined build steps

---

## 7. Portfolio Progression

- Foundational workstation security concepts (e.g., account management and privilege separation) were developed separately in Lab 001
- This project focused on full system deployment, configuration, validation, and documentation
- Together, these efforts demonstrate progression from foundational administration concepts to complete workstation lifecycle management

---

## Summary

This project provided hands-on experience across the full system lifecycle, including planning, assembly, firmware configuration, operating system deployment, troubleshooting, validation, and documentation. The lessons learned will directly inform future workstation deployments and support continued development of professional IT skills.
